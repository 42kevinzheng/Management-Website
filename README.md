EZ Cheezy is needing a website to perform certain tasks. There will be a front end website
created for viewing by the general populace. This will be created using designs given by the Digital Arts
department. In addition to the front end site, there will also be a back end site. This back end site will
need to have a database to perform all the tasks required, as well as multiple pages in php to perform
tasks related to the business. Some of these tasks are listed below, this many not be a complete list, as
requirements may change over time.

1) Create a viewable menu â€“ This must be performed on both the front end and back end sites
2) Be able to enter, edit and delete users in the system, as well as have said users log in when they
are looking to access the back end site. Permissions for what they should be allowed to see and
access should also be adhered to.
3) Be able to enter, edit and delete menu items, while keeping referential integrity.
4) Be able to enter, edit and delete orders that are placed into the system. Entering orders for
take-out must also be on the front end site as well. The customer must select the location they
wish to order from before they place the order. The customer must login before they can order,
and their preferred location should be kept by the system.
5) Be able to enter, edit and delete inventory in the system
6) Be able to view orders that are currently open, as well as past orders.
